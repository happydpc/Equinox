<h1>AF-Twin Data Analyst Beta-Version: Mars</h1>
<par>
This update contains improvements and bug fixes observed during Beta release. It also introduces container technology in order to perform automatic updates
without the need for re-installing the application.
<h3><a name="Important">Important</a></h3>
<UL>
<LI>This update is backward compatible. Databases created with minimum Data Analyst v2.8 will be automatically updated to be compatible with this version.<p>
<LI>Note that, due to application name change and the first time introduction of the container technology, user are required to uninstall the previous version 
of the application (i.e. Equinox) and reinstall Data Analyst container. 
</UL>
<h2><a name="New Features">New Features</a></h2>
<UL>
<LI><item>Application Name Change</item><br><desc>
Client application is renamed from Equinox to AF-Twin Data Analyst (shortly Data Analyst).
</desc><p>
<LI><item>Container Technology</item><br><desc>
Application is now embedded inside an App Container. App container is a platform specific implementation and it is responsible for performing automatic updates. It
also supplies the Java Runtime to execute the embedded application (i.e. Data Analyst).
</desc><p>
<LI><item>Server-side Update</item><br><desc>
A new database connection pooling engine (DBPool) is added to Equinox Hub Server. With this, the server can be run using one of the 2 possible engines: Hikari or DBPool. This
update is intended to solve connection loss issues experienced with the Hikari engine.
</desc><p>
<LI><item>Encrypted Application Settings</item><br><desc>
With this version of Data Analyst, application settings are written to and read from disk using 64bit data encryption.
</desc><p>
<LI><item>Handling Unconventional FLS Files</item><br><desc>
Reading tolerance is introduced in order to handle unconventionally formatted FLS files. It is observed that some of the FLS files did not have space separator between
typical flight name and severities. This prevented Data Analyst to read the files. With the introduction of tolerance reader, application reads the files but warns the user
for unconventional formatting.
</desc><p>
<LI><item>Uploading Container & Application Updates</item><br><desc>
Administrators can now upload container and application update packages to server via the Data Analyst Admin menus.

<h2><a name="Corrections & Bug Fixes">Corrections & Bug Fixes</a></h2>
<UL>
<LI><item>Bug Fix: Bug Reporting</item><br><desc>
Bug reporting system was broken in the previous version. The reason for the bug is the buffer-overflow during network communication due to excessive bug report sizes. Problem is
resolved by splitting bug reports and sending the partitions over the network.</desc><p>
<LI><item>Bug Fix: Equivalent Stress Analysis with Sigma File Input</item><br><desc>
Equivalent stress analysis did not work when Sigma file was supplied as input. Problem was due to wrong table reference to the local database. Bug is fixed.</desc><p>
<LI><item>Bug Fix: User Interface Theme</item><br><desc>
Application did not start if user changed the UI theme from settings menu. This was due to themes other than the default theme not being included in the application package. 
Problem resolved.</desc><p>
<LI><item>Search Pilot Points</item><br><desc>
A feedback that the search results are limited to the top 100 and the order of results is given at the top of results panel.</desc><p>
<LI><item>Airbus Logo</item><br><desc>
Airbus logo blocked the last item in the files list in the previous versions. Issue is resolved.</desc><p>
