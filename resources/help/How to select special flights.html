<h1>How to select special flights</h1>
<par>
Special typical flights are considered as the longest or shortest flights, flights with the highest or lowest 
validity and flights with the maximum or minimum stresses, respectively.<p>These flights can be quickly picked from within the 
file tree. Right-click on a spectrum item and select a special flight from the <item>Select Flight</item> sub-menu (see figure 
below). The flight will be selected in the file tree for further processing.<p><img class="centre" alt="help15" src="image/help15.png">
