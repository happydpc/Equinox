<h1>How to compare damage angles</h1>
<par>
Damage angles can be compared against each other via fatigue and propagation life factors based on a certain damage angle. For this, right-click on a 
damage angle and select <item>Compare Damage Angles</item> from the popup menu as follows;
<p><img class="centre" alt="help51" src="image/help51.png"><p>
This will open the compare damage angles input panel. Following inputs are required;
<UL>
<LI><item>Basis damage angle</item> Select the damage angle that will be used as the basis for the life factor comparison,
<LI><item>Equivalent stress type</item> Select the type of equivalent stress to use for the comparison,
<LI><item>Plotting order</item> Select how the life factors should be ordered within the plot.
</UL>
The fatigue and propagation life factors are based on the following equations;
