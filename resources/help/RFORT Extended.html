<h1>RFORT Extended</h1>
<par>
RFORT Extended plugin performs the automatic reduction of ANA peaks based on applying omission on given pilot points (i.e. stress input files). Depending on the 
omission level defined for each pilot point, a peak from the ANA file is removed only if it is removed from all considered pilot point stress files.
<p>
Starting from version 3.6, the process also includes automating computation of equivalent stresses and generating the following outputs;
<UL>
<LI><item>RFORT result plots:</item> The average number of peaks for each omission level are plotted against the equivalent stress deviations for each pilot point. 
This gives an immediate overall summary of the omission process.
<LI><item>Detailed RFORT reports:</item> RFORT reports can be generated in PDF format. This report contains detailed information of the omission process for each 
pilot point together with all comparison plots.
</UL>
<p>
Following sections describe the inputs necessary to run the plugin via Equinox.
<h2><a name="Spectrum files">Spectrum files</a></h2>
Drag & drop (or browse for) the input spectrum files and select conversion table sheet.
<h2><a name="Equivalent stress analysis type">Equivalent stress analysis type</a></h2>
Select the equivalent stress analysis types (Fatigue, Preffas or Linear propagation) to be run. Equivalent stresses for all input pilot points will be computed for the 
selected analysis types.
<h2><a name="Pilot points">Pilot points</a></h2>
Drag & drop stress input files (STFs) into the designated area. This would add all pilot points to the list. For each pilot point, you can then specify;
<UL>
<LI>Include or exclude the pilot point from the RFORT omission process. When excluded, the pilot point will only be used for computing equivalent stresses.
<LI>Stress factor to be used to scale the loadcases of the pilot point.
<LI>Fatigue, Preffas and Linear propagation materials to be used for equivalent stress analyses. Note that, if needed, you can create additional materials from 
<item>File --> Add New... --> Add New Materials... --> Fatigue/Preffas/Linear Prop. Materials</item>.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Omissions">Omissions</a></h2>
RFORT runs will be performed in parallel for given omissions. Omissions can be defined in two ways:
<UL>
<LI><item>Percentage omissions:</item> Percent omissions are applied on maximum stress amplitudes of each pilot point that are included in the RFORT process.
<LI><item>Direct omission values:</item> Direct omission values can be supplied for each pilot point.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Options">Options</a></h2>
Here, various additional parameters can be supplied. Possible options are as follows;
<UL>
<LI><item>Add delta-P to stress sequences:</item> When selected, delta-p stresses will added into generated stress sequences during the process.
<LI><item>Reference DP:</item> Reference cabin pressure value (only necessary if add delta-p option is selected).
<LI><item>DP factor:</item> Factor to scale delta-p stresses (only necessary if add delta-p option is selected).
<LI><item>Overall factor:</item> Factor to scale all stresses in the generated stress sequences.
<LI><item>Component:</item> Stress component to use from the pilot point stresses file (STF). This can be normal x, y, shear xy or rotated stresses with the 
given rotation angle in degrees.
<LI><item>Run till flight:</item> Generate stress sequence from flight-1 till the given flight number. Leave empty for generating all flights.
<LI><item>Target flights:</item> When entered, omission will be applied to given flights. Comma separated flight numbers are expected in this field (i.e. 
2, 3, 4). Leave this field empty for targeting all flights (default).
<LI><item>Enable SLOG mode:</item> Additional LOG information with additional details of ANA data as would be interpreted by ISAMI. Note that this LOG File is usually 
3 times larger than the ANA file and you may have issues to view the contents. If you need this information for some flights, simply run <item>MyCheck Plugin</item> later for a few flights.
