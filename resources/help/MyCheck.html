<h1>MyCheck</h1>
<par>
MyCheck plugin is a fatigue spectrum validation tool. It checks whether the given fatigue spectrum fulfills 
comformity and quality requirements. Following sections describe the inputs necessary to run the plugin via Equinox.
<h2><a name="Fatigue missions">Fatigue missions</a></h2>
In this section, the fatigue missions to be checked are defined. Each mission requires the following inputs;
<UL>
<LI>Select the fatigue mission type from the drop-down list.
<LI>Drag and drop (or browse for) the following spectrum files specific to the mission;<p>
<UL>
<LI>ANA file (.ana, .gz, .zip),
<LI>TXT file (.txt),
<LI>CVT file (.cvt),
<LI>Conversion table excel file .xls),
<LI>STF file (.stf). Note that, STF file is optional. If no file is given, MyCheck will generate a dummy STF file to perform
the checks.<p>
</UL>
<LI>Select worksheet from the conversion table specific to the mission.
</UL>
By clicking the <item>add</item> button, the mission will be added to the missions list. You can add multiple missions to 
be checked. Note that, when you supply multiple missions that includes a MIX mission, MyCheck will perform an additional 
check to compare the MIX mission against the single missions for comformity.
<h2><a name="Output directory">Output directory</a></h2>
Drag and drop (or browse for) the output directory. After the process is completed, all output files are produced within 
the specified output directory. For each defined fatigue mission, there will be a sub-folder containing the output files 
specific to the mission.
<h2><a name="Count ANA options">Count ANA options</a></h2>
A brief explanation of available options is provided below in the order they appear within the user interface;
<UL>
<LI><item>esg_switch</item><br>Select this option for some Legacy CDFs (e.g. LRESG CDFs) where there is an extra column required 
for the Correlation of Oracle database load case names.<p>
<LI><item>check_round_the_clock</item><br>If selected, additional routines are launched for the assessments of Severity Levels 
Combinations in Increment positions 1 and 2 of the 14 digit codes. Note that all events in all segments (e.g. ground and flight) 
will be investigated, and reported where discrepancies are found. Note: Due to huge data exploitation, expect MyCheck process 
to be slower if this option is selected.<p>
<LI><item>print_special_fsftest</item><br>Additional Information for 1g usage is provided in the LOG files. Usually only used for 
Test Spectra.<p>
<LI><item>print_factors_in_log</item><br>The CVT/TXT factors will be provided together with their relevant Statistics in the LOG 
files. This option is recommended.<p>
<LI><item>write_all_1g_sequence</item><br>An additional LOG file is generated showing list of '1g' available per flight. It might 
be interesting to know why some flights may have missing '1g' segments.<p>
<LI><item>check_4_return_2_1g</item><br>Return to 1g of the Rotation and MLG Impact segments are checked. The CLASS codes relevant 
to these Events are pre-defined per A/C project selected in the MyCheck 'Global Inputs'.<p>
<LI><item>aircraft_program</item><br>This option is valid if check for return to 1g is selected. The rotation and MLG load case codes
are aircraft program specific.<p>
<LI><item>count_flight_separate</item><br>Counts Statistics per flight separately instead of all flights together. Usually needed to 
count Statistics of 'Monster Flights'. The Flights with peaks above number defined for max_pointsper_flight are counted separately. 
If you require all flights to be counted separately, simply select this option and define value of max_pointsper_flight to 1.<p>
<LI><item>max_pointsper_flight</item><br>Not used unless option count_flight_separate is selected. An integer value is expected.<p>
<LI><item>run_only_till_flight_num</item><br>An integer. MyCheck will process the first flights up to this number. Required for quick 
feedbacks and plots on first few flights. Default value is usually very high to ensure MyCheck processes all flights.<p>
<LI><item>cvt_factor_warn</item><br>An Integer Value. A warning will be provided for CVT factors found above this value.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Generate STH options">Generate STH options</a></h2>
A brief explanation of available options is provided below in the order they appear within the user interface;
<UL>
<LI><item>enable_SLOG_mode</item><br>Additional LOG information with additional details of ANA data as would be interpreted by ISAMI. 
Note that this LOG File is usually 3 times larger than the ANA file and you may have issues to view the contents. If you need this 
information for some flights, simply RUN MyCheck later for a few Flights.<p>
<LI><item>esg_on</item><br>Select this option for some Legacy CDFs (e.g. LRESG CDFs) where there is an extra column required for the 
Correlation of Oracle database load case names.<p>
<LI><item>warn_if_li_nl_cases_comb</item><br>If selected, additional warnings are provided when Linear and NonLinear cases are 
combined!<p>
<LI><item>Delete_Negative_Values_from_Spectrum / set_it_zero</item><br>YES/NO? (Yes will delete all negative Values from Stress 
Sequence).<p>
<LI><item>add2sth_Delta_P</item><br>Select this option to Use the Delta Pressure Load case for the profile plots generation. Not needed 
for CDFs with no Delta Pressure profile.<p>
<LI><item>reference_Delta_P</item><br>The 'Reference Delta Pressure' value is required here. This is the value also provided in the 
'ConvTable'. However for Active Pilot Points, please confirm from Stress Teams which Value they are using.<p>
<LI><item>delta_p_fac_only</item><br>Factor multiplies ONLY Delta Pressure Unitary Loadcase Value.<p>
<LI><item>fatigue_fac_all</item><br>Factor multiplies all Unitary Loadcase Values (i.e. Mechanical, Thermal and Pressure Cases)<p>
<LI><item>use_stress_column</item><br>The Pilot Points or STF files may have several columns (e.g. for loads in different X, Y, Z 
directions) and only 1 direction (e.g. main X loads) needs to be investigated. Also for standard Pilot Points or STF with only 1 
columns, please set the value of this option to 1. A maximum of 3 columns is recognized.<p>
<LI><item>rotation_degrees</item><br>Provide a Rotation Angle (i.e. 0 to 180) for the rotation of Stresses. Usually only required 
for 'Plausibility' Analyses of 2D Element Stresses where the Customer explicitely requires to have feedback on 'Maximum Damage Angle'. 
The angle value provided here is only used if use_stress_column value is set to Zero (i.e. 0).<p>
<LI><item>run_only_till_flight_num</item><br>An integer number. MyCHECK will process the first flights up to this number. Required for 
quick feedbacks and plots on first few flights. Default value is usually very high to ensure MyCHECK processes all flights.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Plot options">Plot options</a></h2>
<UL>
<LI><item>show_text_more</item><br>More explanatory 'Text' will be displayed with the Plots. Do not select this option if you can do 
without this additional information.<p>
<LI><item>flights_per_page</item><br>Define how many Flights you wish to have plotted per page. Note that Selecting too many flights 
per page may crowd the page AND selecting too few flights per page may lead to too many pages. However the choice is yours.<p>
<LI><item>load_flights_up2num</item><br>Only these number of Flights will be loaded for plotting purposes. An integer is expected. 
To plot all flights just input a number more than the total number of flights in the CDF.<p>
<LI><item>do_fixed_scale_x</item><br>This option provides the possibility to fix the scaling of the X-axis which is otherwise Dynamic 
to allow all Data to be shown no matter how large or long. However for dedicated 'Plausibility' analyses you may require to fix the 
scaling to ease the visual comparison of two sets of different of similar data.<p>
<LI><item>force_scale_x_to</item><br>Provide a Fixed Scaling Factor value to be used for X-axis. Note that this value is only used when 
the option do_fixed_scale_x is selected.<p>
<LI><item>do_fixed_scale_y</item><br>This option provides the possibility to fix the scaling of the Y-axis which is otherwise Dynamic to 
allow all Data to be shown no matter how large or long. However for dedicated 'Plausibility' analyses you may require to fix the scaling 
to ease the visual comparison of two sets of different of similar data.<p>
<LI><item>force_scale_y_to</item><br>Provide a Fixed Scaling Factor value to be used for Y-axis. Note that this value is only used when 
the option do_fixed_scale_y is selected.<p>
<LI><item>shift_Y_text_to</item><br>Although explanatory comments are very useful in plots, there may be occasions when a certain plot area 
of particular interesting may be covered by 'Text'. This option allows you to shift text vertically.<p>
<LI><item>neutral_axis_y_shift</item><br>This option allows the vertical shift of the 'Neutral Axis' of plots. It is usually mainly required 
for Pilot Points with significant Negative loads/stresses where you may require to focus on the Negative quadrant.
