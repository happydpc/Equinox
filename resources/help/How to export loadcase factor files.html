<h1>How to export loadcase factor files</h1>
<par>
Exporting loadcase factors files is necessary when the loadcase factors files need to be uploaded into the AFM database. For this, right-click on the 
spectrum or pilot point which the loadcase factors files are relevant to and select <item>Export Loadcase Factor Files...</item> from the popup menu.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help71" src="image/help71.png"><p>
This opens the export loadcase factors files panel. Drag & drop the loadcase factors files in the designated area. In the panel, basic loadcase factor 
attributes such as pilot point name, spectrum name and etc. can be edited. This will export the loadcase factors files with the information into a zip archive. 
The archive can then be sent to the database administrator for uploading into AFM database.
