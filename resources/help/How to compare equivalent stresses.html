<h1>How to compare equivalent stresses</h1>
<par>
Equivalent stresses can be compared via equivalent stress values or life factors. Following video demonstrates this process.

For this, select the equivalent stresses you want to compare from the file tree, right-click and select <item>
Compare Equivalent Stresses</item> from the popup menu as shown in the following figure.

You should first select a comparison criteria (i.e. what to compare). This can be either direct equivalent stress values or 
life factors derived from a basis mission. For life factor comparison, basis mission shall also be selected. The life factor 
calculation is based on the following equations;

Life factors can be plotted against mission parameters assigned to spectra. For this, select basis mission of comparison and 
select <item>Plot against mission parameters</item>. Finally, select the mission parameter that you want 
to plot and click ok. Note that, mission parameters should have been set to spectra prior to performing this operation. For more 
information see <button type="button" onclick="app.helpLink('How to edit spectrum info', '')" id="buttonlink">Creating mission parameters</button>.
