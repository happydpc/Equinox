<h1>How to export spectrum</h1>
<par>
Exporting spectrum is necessary when the spectrum needs to be uploaded into the ESCSAS database. For this, right-click on the 
spectrum file (or multiple spectrum files) in the file tree and select <item>Export Spectrum...</item> from the popup menu.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help52" src="image/help69.png"><p>
This opens the export spectrum panel. In the panel, basic spectrum attributes such as A/C program, 
A/C section, fatigue mission and etc. can be edited. This will export the spectrum with the information into a zip archive. The 
archive can then be sent to the database administrator for uploading into ESCSAS database.
