<h1>How to plot level crossing</h1>
<par>
Once equivalent stresses are calculated, cycle count information is available for creating the level 
crossing plots. Following video demonstrates how to do this.

For this, right click on an <item>Equivalent Stress</item> item (or multiple items) and select 
<item>Plot Level Crossing</item>;

By default, cycle counts are normalized with spectrum validities. Instead, you can also input the DSG for each level crossing. 
Rainflow cycle counts are scaled with the DSG values for generating the plot.

Generated level crossings plot will contain series for each compared spectrum. In order to uniquely identify each spectrum, 
the name of the series can include A/C program, A/C section, fatigue mission and rainflow omission levels, depending on the 
selected options.
