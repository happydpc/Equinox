<h1>How to save 2D STF files as 1D STF files</h1>
<par>
You can transform 2D STF stress input files into 1D STF files via right-clicking on an STF file and selecting 
<item>Save as 1D STF...</item> from the popup menu as shown in the following figure. Transformation can be 
performed by either selecting a stress component (normal-x, normal-y or shear-xy) or by entering a rotation angle 
to rotate the stress tensor.
