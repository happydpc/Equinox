Excalibur is a GFEM stress extraction and sorting tool. It utilizes fatigue spectrum - loadcase correlations in order to
generate stress input files (STFs). Following sections describe the inputs necessary to run the plugin via Equinox. Click on
the following button for a quick demonstration of the plugin in action.

<h2><a name="Loadcase correlations">Loadcase correlations</a></h2>
In this section, the fatigue spectrum loadcase correlations are supplied. Following 2 files are expected as inputs;
<UL>
<LI><i>Attributes table (.xls)</i> Attributes table file is similar to a spectrum conversion table, but it also contains 
additional loadcase information such as load type and criteria.
<LI><i>Loadcase keys file (.lck)</i> This file contains EGL loadcase names, loadcase numbers and loadcase family information.
</UL>
Note that, usually correlation pairs are supplied for a certain A/C section and fatigue mission.
<h2><a name="Element stresses">Element stresses</a></h2>
Extracted GFEM element stresses are supplied within this section. First, select the stress type of input files, then browse
(or darg & drop) the directory that contains all input stress files. Note that standard ISAMI generated GFEM stress files are the 
expected file format. Each file should contain stresses for only 1 element.
<h2><a name="Pressure">Pressure</a></h2>
Cabin pressure loadcases are usually not contained within the loadcase correlatons. Therefore, in case delta-p cases are to be included, 
enter the delta-p loadcase number within the stress files.
<h2><a name="Stress sorting criteria">Stress sorting criteria</a></h2>
Based on the selected criteria, 1 loadcase will be selected from a lodcase family representing each fatigue event within the correlated 
spectrum. Stress sorting criteria depends on the input stress type selected in the <i>Element stresses</i> section.
<h2><a name="Output directory">Output directory</a></h2>
Select the output directory where the generated stress input files will be saved. Note that, the following 2 directories will be created 
within the given output directory;
<UL>
<LI><i>stfs</i> This directory will contain all generated stress input files.
<LI><i>logs</i> This directory will contain all generated log files. Note that, no log file wile will be generated if log level is selected 
as <i>off</i>.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Options">Options</a></h2>
Here, you can select the log level and whether to run the stress sorting tasks in parallel or sequentially.
