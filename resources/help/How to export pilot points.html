<h1>How to export pilot points</h1>
<par>
Exporting pilot points is necessary when the pilot points need to be uploaded into the ESCSAS database. For this, right-click on the 
pilot point (or multiple pilot points) in the file tree and select <item>Export Pilot Point...</item> from the popup menu.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help70" src="image/help70.png"><p>
This opens the export pilot point panel. In the panel, basic pilot point attributes such as pilot point name, spectrum name, fatigue mission 
(in case it is overridden by the pilot point) and etc. can be edited. You can also supply a descriptive image for the pilot point when available.
This will export the pilot point with the information into a zip archive. The archive can then be sent to the database administrator for 
uploading into ESCSAS database.
