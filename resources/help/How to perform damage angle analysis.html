<h1>How to perform damage angle analysis</h1>
<par>
Damage angle analysis is performed to obtain the maximum damaging angle for 2D stress states. At the end of the analysis, maximum damaging 
angle (in degrees) and the related equivalent stress value are computed. In addition, all incremental angles with their equivalent stresses 
are also displayed from within the Equinox UI. Following video demonstrates how to do this.
<p>
<button type="button" class="hoverButton" onclick="app.helpVideoLink('How to perform damage angle analysis')" style="vertical-align:middle"><span>Play Demo</span></button>
<br>
For this, right-click on a 2D STF file in the file tree and select 
<item>Damage Angle Analysis</item> from the popup menu as follows;<p><img class="centre" alt="help39" src="image/help39.png"><p>
This will open the damage angle analysis input panel. Input panel contains all necessary input fields in order to perform the analysis. 
These are; stress sequence generation parameters, material data, rainflow omission parameters, iteration settings and post-processing options. 
You can find detailed information on the first 3 input panels from the following links;
<UL>
<LI><button type="button" onclick="app.helpLink('How to generate stress sequence', '')" id="buttonlink">Generating stress sequence,</button>
<LI><button type="button" onclick="app.helpLink('How to calculate equivalent stress', '')" id="buttonlink">Calculating equivalent stress</button>.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Iteration Settings">Iteration Settings</a></h2>
Overall iteration parameters govern damage angle analysis iteration cycle;
<UL>
<LI><item>Angle range:</item> Select the start and end angles in degrees. Analysis will be performed within this range.
<LI><item>Increment angle:</item> The angle in degrees for rotating the stresses in each iteration step. Stress sequence will be generated 
for each incremental angle within the given angle range calculated by the given increment angle.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Post-processing">Post-processing</a></h2>
You can keep the generated stress sequence for the maximum damaging equivalent stress of your choice. The stress sequence will be kept in the database.
