<h1>How to report a bug</h1>

the following figure. Just click on the <item>Report Bug</item> button to send detailed bug report to the server.

It is also possible to compose and send a bug report manually. For this, click <item>Help &#8594; Report a Bug</item>.
<h2><a name="Bug description">Bug description</a></h2>
Describe the problem as precisely as possible with the correct event order. What happened just before, during and after the problem occurred? 
You can use upto 1000 characters. The better the description the sooner the solution.
<h2><a name="Options">Options</a></h2>
In addition to your description, information about your system can also be added to the report. System information is useful for resolving 
platform specific problems. Following system information is collected;

<LI>Operating system name, version and architecture.
<LI>Java Virtual Machine name, vendor and version.
<LI>Java Runtime Environment name and version.
