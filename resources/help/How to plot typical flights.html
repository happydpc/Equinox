<h1>How to plot typical flights</h1>
<par>
You can plot each typical flight once the stress sequence is generated. Following video demonstrates how to do this.

Typical flights can be plotted by right-clicking on a flight (or multiple flights) in the file tree 
and selecting <item>Plot Flight</item> from the popup menu.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help16" src="image/help16.png"><p>By default, all peaks of the selected flight(s) will be plotted. Next 
sections describe how to zoom into the plot, decomposing and plotting stress components, showing peak information and highlighting 
flight segments, respectively.
<h2><a name="Zooming in plot">Zooming in plot</a></h2>
You can zoom-in/out via the mouse wheel or by selecting the zoom area. For this, press and hold the left mouse button from the 
top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the area you want to zoom (see figure below). Drag the mouse to any other direction 
to zoom back to original view.

<h2><a name="Plotting stress components">Plotting stress components</a></h2>
1G, increment, delta-p and delta-t stress components can be decomposed and plotted separately via the <item>Select Stress Components</item> input panel. 
Select the stress components you want to plot and click <item>Refresh</item>. Note that, stress components can be plotted on the 
total stresses by selecting the <item>Plot on total stress</item> option. By default, all components (i.e. total stress) 
is plotted.
<h2><a name="Showing Peak Information">Showing Peak Information</a></h2>
Select the peak information to be displayed from the <item>Show Peak Information</item> input panel. By default total stress is 
displayed. You will see that the selected information will be displayed on the bottom-right corner of the plot view as you pick 
new peaks.
<h2><a name="Highlighting Flight Segments">Highlighting Flight Segments</a></h2>
Flight segments can be highlighted from within the <item>Show Segment</item> input panel. For this, select the flight 
and the segment you want to highlight, and click <item>Show</item>. Flight segment is highlighted on the spectrum plot via 
interval markers.
