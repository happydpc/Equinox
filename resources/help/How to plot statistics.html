<h1>How to plot statistics</h1>
<par>
Flight-by-flight stress sequence statistics can be generated and displayed for various statistic types. Following video demonstrates how to do this.
<p>
<button type="button" class="hoverButton" onclick="app.helpVideoLink('How to plot statistics')" style="vertical-align:middle"><span>Play Demo</span></button>
<br>
For this, right-click on any stress sequence item 
in the file tree and select <item>Plot Statistics</item> from the menu as shown in the following figure.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help12" src="image/help12.png"><p>You can also show statistics by right-clicking on typical flights in the file 
tree.<sup>(1, 2)</sup>
<h2><a name="Select statistics">Select statistics</a></h2>
This panel provides the statistic types to generate. Event occurrences can be multiplied by the flight occurrences.
<p><img class="centre" alt="help62" src="image/help62.png">
<h2><a name="Select events">Select events</a></h2>
Select a 1g or incremental event to generate the statistics. You can search for the event by its name, load case number or conversion 
table comment. For instance, selecting <item>Maximum total stress</item> statistic for the event <item>Cruise</item><sup>(3)</sup> 
will generate comparison of maximum total stresses of all typical flights for the cruise event.<p><img class="centre" alt="help13" src="image/help13.png">
<h2><a name="Options">Options</a></h2>
Following optional inputs can be given;
<UL>
<LI><item>Max. flights/events:</item> Maximum number of results to be generated. This is the number of flights to compare when showing 
statistics for multiple flight selections, or it is the maximum number of events to compare for single flight selection.
<LI><item>Results order:</item> Order of results. For a flight comparison, <item>Descending</item> means the comparison will 
include the top 10 (max. flights) flight values.
<LI><item>Show data labels:</item> Select this if you want to see the data labels on the chart.
</UL>
<h2><a name="Generated statistics">Generated statistics</a></h2>
The generated statistics are displayed on a column chart as shown in the following figure. The chart plot can be saved to 
disk by clicking <item>Save view</item> button (see figure).

<br><sup>(1)</sup> Statistic types <item>Validity</item> and <item>Number of peaks</item> are available only for multiple 
flight selections (or entire spectrum selection).
<br><sup>(2)</sup> Generated statistics are based on event comparison for single flight selection. Whereas they are based on 
flight comparison for multiple flight selections.
<br><sup>(3)</sup> Event names and comments may differ from spectrum to spectrum.
