<h1>How to calculate equivalent stress from STF file</h1>
<par>
Equivalent stresses can be calculated directly from stress input files (STF). Following video demonstrates how to do this.
<p>
<button type="button" class="hoverButton" onclick="app.helpVideoLink('How to calculate equivalent stress from STF file')" style="vertical-align:middle"><span>Play Demo</span></button>
<br>
For this, select and right-click on a STF file (or multiple STF files), 
and select <item>Equivalent Stress Analysis</item> from the popup menu as shown in the following figure.<p><img class="centre" alt="help60" src="image/help60.png"><p>

There are two analysis options as follows;
<UL>
<LI><item>Fast Analysis</item> This option is suitable for performing large number of analyses as the process is 3 to 4 times faster than the detailed analysis. Only equivalent stresses will be 
generated as outputs and no plot or typical flight information will be generated. Plots can still be generated on demand once the analysis is complete.<p>
<LI><item>Detailed Analysis</item> This option is suitable for performing detailed investigations on pilot points as all analysis data such as plots (mission profile, level crossing etc.) and 
spectrum statistics will be generated.

The process for calculating the equivalent stress directly from stress input file is composed of 2 sequential steps as listed below. Click on the links to see detailed information for 
each step.
