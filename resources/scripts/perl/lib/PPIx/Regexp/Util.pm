=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Util - Utility functions for PPIx::Regexp;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Util qw{ __instance };
     .
     .
     .
 __instance( $foo, 'Bar' )
     or die '$foo is not a Bar';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains utility functions for L<PPIx::Regexp|PPIx::Regexp>
which it is convenient to centralize.

The contents of this module are B<private> to the
L<PPIx::Regexp|PPIx::Regexp> package. This documentation is provided for
the author's convenience only. Anything in this module is subject to
change without notice. I<Caveat user.>

This module exports nothing by default.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

This module can export the following subroutines:

=head2 __instance

 __instance( $foo, 'Bar' )
     and print '$foo isa Bar', "\n";

This subroutine returns true if its first argument is an instance of the
class specified by its second argument. Unlike C<UNIVERSAL::isa>, the
result is always false unless the first argument is a reference.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Params::Util|Params::Util>, which I recommend, but in the case of
C<PPIx::Regexp> I did not want to introduce a dependency on an XS module
when all I really wanted was the function of that module's
C<_INSTANCE()> subroutine.


=head1 SUPPORT

Support is by the author. Please file bug reports at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>, or in electronic mail to the author.
