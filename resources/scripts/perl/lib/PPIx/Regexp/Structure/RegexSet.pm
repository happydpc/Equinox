=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Structure::RegexSet - Represent a regexp character set

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{(?[ \w - [fox] ])}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Structure::RegexSet> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Structure>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Structure::RegexSet> has no descendants.

=head1 RESTRICTION

When running under Perl 5.6, the extended white space characters are not
recognized as white space.

=begin comment

See the code in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal that generates
$regex_set_space for the actual machinery. The reason for the
restriction is that I was, for some reason, not able to get '\x{...}' to
work.

=end comment

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a regex character set.

These were introduced in Perl 5.17.8, and documented as experimental and
subject to change. If changes introduced in Perl result in changes in
the way C<PPIx::Regexp> parses the regular expression, C<PPIx::Regexp>
will track the change, even if they are incompatible with the previous
parse. If this functionality is retracted and the syntax used for
something else, C<PPIx::Regexp> will forget completely about regex
character sets.

At some point, the documentation started calling these "Extended
Bracketed Character Classes", and documenting them in
L<perlrecharclass|perlrecharclass>.

=head1 METHODS

This class supports no public methods over and above those supported by
the superclasses.

=head1 SUPPORT
