=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Constant - Constants for the PPIx::Regexp system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Constant qw{ TOKEN_UNKNOWN }
 print "An unknown token's class is TOKEN_UNKNOWN\n";

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Constant> is an L<Exporter|Exporter>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Constant> has no descendants.

=head1 DETAILS

This module defines manifest constants for use by the various
C<PPIx::Regexp> modules. These constants are to be considered B<private>
to the C<PPIx::Regexp> system, and the author reserves the right to
change them without notice.

This module exports the following manifest constants:

=head2 COOKIE_CLASS

The name of the cookie used to control the construction of character
classes.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> when
the left square bracket is encountered, and cleared in the same module
when a right square bracket is encountered.

=head2 COOKIE_QUANT

The name of the cookie used to control the construction of curly
bracketed quantifiers.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> when a
left curly bracket is encountered. It requests itself to be cleared on
encountering anything other than a literal comma, a literal digit, or an
interpolation, or if more than one comma is encountered. If it survives
until L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure>
processes the right curly bracket, it is cleared there.

=head2 COOKIE_QUOTE

The name of the cookie used to control the parsing of C<\Q ... \E>
quoted literals.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control> when a
C<\Q> is encountered, and it persists until the next C<\E>.

=head2 COOKIE_REGEX_SET

The name of the cookie used to control regular expression sets.

=head2 MINIMUM_PERL

The minimum version of Perl understood by this parser, as a float. It is
currently set to 5.000, since that is the minimum version of Perl
accessible to the author.

=head2 MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS

The name of the
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> group
used to control match semantics.

=head2 RE_CAPTURE_NAME

A string representation of a regular expression that matches the name of
a named capture buffer.

=head2 STRUCTURE_UNKNOWN

The name of the class that represents the unknown structure. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown|PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown>.

=head2 TOKEN_LITERAL

The name of the class that represents a literal token. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal>.

=head2 TOKEN_UNKNOWN

The name of the class that represents the unknown token. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown>.
