=begin comment

The following is from perlop:

       The character following "\c" is mapped to some other character by
       converting letters to upper case and then (on ASCII systems) by
       inverting the 7th bit (0x40). The most interesting range is from '@' to
       '_' (0x40 through 0x5F), resulting in a control character from 0x00
       through 0x1F. A '?' maps to the DEL character. On EBCDIC systems only
       '@', the letters, '[', '\', ']', '^', '_' and '?' will work, resulting
       in 0x00 through 0x1F and 0x7F.

# Recognize all the escaped constructions that generate literal

=head2 ordinal

 print 'The ordinal of ', $token->content(),
     ' is ', $token->ordinal(), "\n";

This method returns the ordinal of the literal if it can figure it out.
It is analogous to the C<ord> built-in.

It will not attempt to determine the ordinal of a unicode name
(C<\N{...}>) unless L<charnames|charnames> has been loaded, and supports
the L<vianame()|charnames/vianame> function. Instead, it will return
C<undef>. Users of Perl 5.6.2 and older may be out of luck here.

Unicode code points (e.g. C<\N{U+abcd}>) should work independently of
L<charnames|charnames>, and just return the value of C<abcd>.

It will never attempt to return the ordinal of an octet (C<\C{...}>)
because I don't understand the syntax.
