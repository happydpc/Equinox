=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure - Represent structural elements.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{(foo)}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> is the parent of
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Delimiter|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Delimiter>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents things that define the structure of the regular
expression. This typically means brackets of various sorts, but to
prevent proliferation of token classes the type of the regular
expression is stored here.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
