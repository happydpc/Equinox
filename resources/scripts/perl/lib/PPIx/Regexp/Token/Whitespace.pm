=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Whitespace> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents whitespace. It will appear inside the regular
expression only if the /x modifier is present, but it may also appear
between the type and the opening delimiter (e.g. C<qr {foo}>) or after
the regular expression in a bracketed substitution (e.g. C<s{foo}
{bar}>).

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.

# it hits a match for \s and finds the regular expression has the /x
# modifier asserted.
