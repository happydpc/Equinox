##This method returns true if the character class is case-sensitive (that
##is, if it may match or not based on the case of the string being
##matched), false (but defined) if it is not, and simply returns (giving
##C<undef> in scalar context and an empty list in list context) if the
##case-sensitivity can not be determined.
