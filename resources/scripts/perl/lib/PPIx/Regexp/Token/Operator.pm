=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Token::Operator - Represent an operator.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
 PPIx::Regexp::Dumper->new( 'qr{foo|bar}smx' )
     ->print();

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Operator> is a
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token|PPIx::Regexp::Token>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Operator> has no descendants.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents an operator. In a character class, it represents
the negation (C<^>) and range (C<->) operators. Outside a character
class, it represents the alternation (C<|>) operator.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides no public methods beyond those provided by its
superclass.
